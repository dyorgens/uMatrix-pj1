uMatrix constructor creates the matrix based on rows and columns 
uMatrix destructor deallocates the memory used by the constructor

Print function prints out the information in the shape of a matrix

uMatrix: MM is the matrix multiplication of both the A and B matricies inputted
uMatrix: MA is the matrix addition of both the A and B matricies inputted

uMatrix: SM is the Scalar multiplication of both the A and B matricies using the scalar value inputted
uMatrix: SA is the Scalar addition of both the A and B matricies using the scalar value inputted

Within the main.cpp I outlined the input for creating the size of rows and columns as well as the value used in the scalar functions
  I also outlined the way to fill in the numbers for each matrix. This must be done number by number, hitting enter after each; or it can   be done by filling in all of the numbers at one time, separating new values by a space.
